# tic-tac-toe

## A simple React Tic-Tac-Toe game that take a minimum of five moves to with. The starter is always the winner and the boad tells who is the winner.

# Roadmap for improvement

## For now, I would increase legibility of text at the bottom of the game display board and increase the size of board. Additional improvements in the future could include other features of the game.
